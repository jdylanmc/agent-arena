# Changelog

All notable changes to **agent-arena** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0][kac], and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].

The constitution at [`.specify/memory/constitution.md`][constitution]
mandates this discipline (see *Changelog discipline* under
*Development Workflow*). Every PR that introduces a user-visible change
MUST add an entry under `[Unreleased]` in the appropriate group.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Spec Kit scaffolding (`.specify/`, `.github/agents/`, `.github/prompts/`,
  `.vscode/settings.json`).
- Project Constitution v1.0.0 (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) defining
  Single Execution Authority, Attributed Identity, Test-First, Traceability
  to Originating Input, Gated Agent Output, and Observable & Interruptible
  Orchestration. The constitution governs the development of this codebase;
  product roles, services, and tech stack are defined in feature specs.
- Knowledge-base scaffolding rules: `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/raw/`,
  `wiki/docs/`, and `wiki/bugs/` (the last for accumulated bug reports
  with confirmed fixes).
- **Deputy agent**: source-controlled persona at `agents/deputy/persona.md`,
  reports directory at `agents/deputy/reports/`, top-level
  `agents/README.md` explainer, and trigger-phrase recognition wired
  into `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. The deputy is the formal
  owner and enforcer of the constitution; invoke with
  `> Start the deputy agent workflow`.
- `README.md` describing project structure and the Spec Kit workflow.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`, following Keep a Changelog 1.1.0.

### Changed

- Spec Kit branch & spec-directory naming switched from **sequential
  numbering** (`001-add-user-auth`) to **timestamp prefix**
  (`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-add-user-auth`). Parallel cloud agents no longer
  race for the next sequential number, and date-prefixed specs let us
  revisit old specs chronologically and re-assert their primary
  assumptions and goals over time. Affects `.specify/init-options.json`,
  `.specify/extensions/git/git-config.yml`,
  `.specify/extensions/git/config-template.yml`, and
  `.specify/extensions/git/extension.yml`.
